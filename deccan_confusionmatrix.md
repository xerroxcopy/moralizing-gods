Problems:

- i think the page title of Chalukyas of Kalyani (Polity InHoysa) is wrong (as in http://seshatdatabank.info/nature/polities/chalukyas-of-kalyani-InHoysa  for the page actually explaining Hoysala. The Polity ID is fine: the name is wrong).
- i think the deccan page indices are wrong.
- what caused the gap of Chalukyas ending year ranging from 1050 - 1191?
- when did Hoysalas' reigning of deccan area started? 1026 (not likely), 1192 (csv and Deccan page for Chalukyas), or 1108(Hoysala page on Seshat)?
